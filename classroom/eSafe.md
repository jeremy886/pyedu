## Provide an offline environment as the first perference

Reasons:
* always work and easy to adapt for children who cannot access reliable internet or for schools with very strict policies
* easy to create and matintain for teachers compared to online tools

I want to use github (like this) for students to share ideas.
Instead: use an offline markdown editor like [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter/releases) assuming you have a way to collect and share files
